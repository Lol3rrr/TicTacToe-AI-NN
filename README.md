# TicTacToe AI-NN

Is a simple Python-Program where you play TicTacToe against an AI, which has no idea of what is going on at first but learns from the steps you make and tries to replicate them making it improve over time.

## Getting Started

### Using the source code

This is the better method if you not only want to run it yourself but also want to change somethings around.

#### Installing

You will need python 3 (I'm using version 3.7.2 at the moment)
You can check if you have the correct version installed by running `python --version`, which should output something like `Python 3.7.2`.
If it gives you an error or you need to install python you can download it from the [Official Python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or follow other tutorials on how to do that.

Once you have Python installed you can clone the repository by executing `https://github.com/Lol3rrr/TicTacToe-AI-NN.git` in your terminal or by using the github desktop application

#### Running

Then navigate into the new folder and simple run `python main.py` to start it.

### Using the executable

This is the easier way if you just want to run the program and try it out and play some games with it.

#### Installing

To 'install' it you just need to download the latest executable under the release tab

#### Running

After downloading it you can just execute the program like a normal application
